# 105-unit-3

## Overview

This is a repository containing instructional materials & sample datasets for Professor Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL105 at UNC Chapel Hill.

The respirtory contains 3 python notebooks:
1. module on basic topics in coding with Python 3
2. module on getting started with the Pandas package
3. module on using the Pandas package for data analysis

These materials have been adapted from the lessons created by the staff at the Research Hub of UNC's Davis Library (Link).

## Provenence

The CountyPublicHealthData.csv files was provided to me by Professor Gotzler of which he obtained it from (location w/ link?).

## Purpose

This data is to be used by anyone & everyone who pleases to explore more on Public Health from 2014 to 2015.

## Potential

This repository was created as part of an assignment in the ENGL105 course I'm taking at UNC Chapel Hill.
