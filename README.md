# 105-unit-3

## Overview

### This is a repository containing:

- a .csv file to the County Public Health Data (2014-2015)
- python notebooks on how to effectively use & work with the data stated above
- another .csv file to a smaller subset from which I made from the County Public Health Data focusing on Premature Death in WY counties
- a bar chart displaying the data within the Premature Death subset

## Provenence

The CountyPublicHealthData.csv file was provided to me by Professor Gotzler of which he obtained it from (location w/ link).

## Purpose

This data is to be used by anyone & everyone who pleases to explore more on Public Health from 2014 to 2015.

## Potential

This repository was created as part of an assignment in the ENGL105 course I'm taking at UNC Chapel Hill. Others may use this data to explore different aspects of health within different areas of the US, use this data in part with others to look at change regarding health over time, etc.

For example, here is a graph of the subset I created with the larger county health data:
